# THE BREAD AND BUTTER STARTER PROJECT
`Unity ver. 6000.0.26f1` `URP` `2D` `DOTween` `Addressables` `New Input System` `Textmesh Pro`

This is a freshly baked starter project template with "universally desirable" built-in modules based on the building blocks and source code slices of the game ["Enter The Night" on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2624990).
<br>
<br>This is a work in progress and mostly to be used by me and my future games, but you're free to use them as as you wish. One day I'll create the true <b>"Ultimate Starter Project"</b>, but for now you can expect:
<br>
<br>- Placeholder title screen
<br>- Placeholder loading screen
<br>- Configurations menu with settings persistency
<br>- Scenes Manager
<br>- Visual Effects Manager (w/ object pooling)
<br>- Prop Instantiator Manager (w/ object pooling)
<br>- Interaction Tooltips Manager
<br>- Custom Cursor Manager
<br>- Audio Manager (w/ automatic audio source pooling)
<br>- Addressables Manager
<br>- Saving and Loading
<br>- Multiple Save Slots
<br>- Debug HUD (w/ FPS counter, timescale buttons, in-game console log window)
<br>- Useful extensions (eg. List GetRandom())
<br>- Useful tween scripts (eg. OnEnableTweenPosition, OnClickShakeScale)
<br>
<br>Once I have time I'll come back and add a few more non-intrusive "nice to have" core module and extensions suitable for any game project. So come by often, you might find something new and useful.
<br><br>You're free to study, copy, modify and/or add it to your own personal or commercial project, just don't resell it as it is. All visual and audio assets featured in this template are not my own, but are available for free on itch.io and other asset stores.
